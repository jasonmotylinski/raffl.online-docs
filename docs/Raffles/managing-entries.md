# Managing Raffle Entries

Once a raffle is created, you can manage individual ticket entries, including adding sponsors for tickets.

## Accessing Entry Management

1. In the top navigation bar, click **Raffles**.
2. Click on the raffle name to open the edit page.
3. Navigate to the **Entries** tab.

## Entry Types

Raffle entries can have different statuses:

- **Unclaimed** – Available for purchase by participants.
- **Pending** – A participant has claimed the entry and has 5 minutes to complete payment.
- **Purchased** – The entry was purchased through PayPal. The buyer's name is displayed.
- **Sponsored** – The entry was assigned a sponsor name by you (the admin).

## Adding Sponsors to Entries

You can manually assign sponsor names to entries. This is useful when someone pays outside of PayPal or when you want to reserve entries for sponsors.

1. Find the entry number you want to sponsor.
2. Enter the sponsor name in the field.
3. Click **Save** to apply changes.

Sponsored entries will display the sponsor name on the public raffle page.

## Removing Sponsors

To remove a sponsor from an entry:

1. Find the entry with the sponsor name.
2. Clear the sponsor name field.
3. Click **Save**.

The entry will return to an unclaimed state (unless it has a PayPal purchase associated).

## Deleting Entries

To remove an entry entirely:

1. Locate the entry you want to delete.
2. Click the delete button for that entry.

Deleting an entry removes it from the raffle. Use caution when deleting entries that have been purchased.
