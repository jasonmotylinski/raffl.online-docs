# How Raffle Purchases Work

This page explains how participants purchase raffle entries and what happens during the process.

## Purchase Flow

1. **Participant visits the raffle page** – They see all available entries.
2. **Participant selects an entry** – They click to claim a specific ticket number.
3. **Entry is held** – The entry is marked as "pending" for 5 minutes while they complete payment.
4. **PayPal payment** – The participant completes payment through PayPal.
5. **Entry confirmed** – Once payment is received, the entry shows as purchased with the buyer's name.

## Entry Limits

Participants can claim up to **6 entries** per raffle. This prevents any single person from claiming too many entries.

## Pending Entries

When someone claims an entry, it's held for **5 minutes**. During this time:

- The entry appears as "pending" on the raffle page.
- Other participants cannot claim that entry.
- If payment isn't completed within 5 minutes, the entry becomes available again.

## PayPal Fees

The ticket price you set is the base cost. During checkout, PayPal fees are added automatically:

- **Fee calculation:** 3.7% + $0.50 per transaction

For example, a $10 ticket would have a total cost of approximately $10.87 ($10 + $0.37 + $0.50).

## Buyer Information

When an entry is purchased through PayPal, the buyer's name and email from their PayPal account are captured and associated with the entry. The buyer's name is displayed on the public raffle page.
