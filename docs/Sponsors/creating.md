# Creating a Sponsor Event

## Step 1: Start a New Sponsor Event

1. In the top navigation bar, click **Sponsor Events**.
2. Click **Create Sponsor Event** to start a new event.

## Step 2: Event Details

Fill out the following information:

- **Event Name** – The name of your sponsor event (e.g., "TDCI 2025 Specialty", "Dog Show Sponsorship")
- **Unique URL Name** – A custom URL slug for your sponsor page (e.g., `tdci-2025-specialty`). This will be used in your public link: `/sponsor/your-url-name`
- **Event Status** – Choose **Active** to publish the event or **Inactive** to hide it

Click **Edit** to save your event details.

!!! note
    The event is not yet published. You'll need to add days and classes before sponsors can purchase spaces.

## Next Steps

After creating your event, proceed to:

1. **[Add Days](setup.md#adding-days)** – Define the columns (days/sessions) in your sponsorship grid
2. **[Add Groups & Classes](setup.md#adding-groups-and-classes)** – Define the rows and organize them into groups
3. **[Set Pricing](pricing.md)** – Set the price for each sponsorship space

Once all three steps are complete, your sponsor event will be ready for sponsors to purchase spaces.
