# Sponsor Events

Sponsor events allow you to create sponsorship opportunities with a grid-based layout. Each sponsorship space has its own price and can be purchased separately.

## What are Sponsor Events?

A sponsor event is organized into:

- **Days** – Represent columns in your sponsorship grid (e.g., "Friday AM", "Friday PM", "Saturday")
- **Groups** – Organize classes into sections (e.g., "Puppy Classes", "Adult Classes")
- **Classes** – Represent rows within groups (e.g., "Best Puppy 4-6", "Best of Breed")
- **Sponsorship Spaces** – Individual cells at the intersection of a day and class, each with its own price

For example, a dog show might have:
- **Days:** Friday AM, Friday PM, Saturday AM, Saturday PM
- **Groups:** Puppy Classes, Junior Classes, Adult Classes, Senior Classes
- **Classes:** Best Puppy, Reserve Puppy, etc. (within each group)
- **Sponsorship Spaces:** 4 days × 3 classes = 12 sponsorship spaces per group

## Sponsor Event Workflow

Setting up a sponsor event follows a 4-step workflow:

1. **Event Details** – Name, URL, and status
2. **Days** – Create columns representing different days or sessions
3. **Groups & Classes** – Organize sponsorship spaces into groups and rows
4. **Pricing** – Set the price for each sponsorship space

Once setup is complete, the event is published and sponsors can purchase spaces through the public page.
