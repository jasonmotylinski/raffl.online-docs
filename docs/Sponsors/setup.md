# Setting Up Days, Groups & Classes

After creating a sponsor event, you need to set up the structure of your sponsorship grid:

1. **Days** – Columns representing different days or sessions
2. **Groups** – Sections that organize classes (e.g., "Puppy Classes")
3. **Classes** – Individual rows within groups (e.g., "Best Puppy", "Reserve Puppy")

## Adding Days

Days represent the **columns** in your sponsorship grid (e.g., "Friday AM", "Friday PM", "Saturday").

### To Add a Day:

1. Click the **Days** tab in the left navigation
2. Click **+ Add Day**
3. Enter the following:
   - **Date** – The date of the day/session (optional, but recommended)
   - **Description** – How the day will be labeled in the grid (e.g., "Friday AM", "Round 1")
4. Click **Add Day**

The day will appear in the table. You can add multiple days.

### To Edit a Day:

1. In the Days table, modify the description or date directly in the input fields
2. Click **Save**

### To Delete a Day:

1. Click the **Delete** button next to the day
2. Confirm the deletion (this will also delete all sponsor spaces associated with that day)

!!! warning
    Deleting a day will remove all sponsorship spaces for that day, even if they've been sold. Use with caution.

## Adding Groups & Classes

Groups organize classes into sections. Each group can contain multiple classes. Classes represent the **rows** in your sponsorship grid.

### To Add a Group:

1. Click the **Groups & Classes** tab in the left navigation
2. Click **+ Add Group**
3. Enter the **Group Name** (e.g., "Puppy Classes", "Adult Classes")
4. Click **Add Group**

The group will appear as a collapsible accordion section.

### To Add a Class:

1. Click the **Groups & Classes** tab
2. Expand the group where you want to add a class
3. In the "Classes in this group" section, enter the **Class Name** (e.g., "Best Puppy", "Best of Breed")
4. Click **+ Add Class**

### To Edit a Group or Class:

1. In the **Groups & Classes** tab, click the **Edit Groups & Classes** section
2. For **Group Name**: Modify the text field next to the group and click **Save**
3. For **Class Name**: Modify the text field next to the class and click **Save**

### To Delete a Group or Class:

1. Click the **Delete Group** or **Delete** button
2. Confirm the deletion

## Understanding Sponsorship Spaces

When you add days and classes, the system automatically creates **sponsorship spaces** for each combination.

For example:
- If you have 4 days and 3 classes in a group, you'll have 12 sponsorship spaces (4 × 3)
- Each space can be purchased independently and have a different price

You can view the total number of sponsorship spaces in the **Pricing** tab.

## Best Practices

- **Add Days First** – Start by adding all your days/sessions
- **Then Add Groups & Classes** – After days are complete, add groups and classes
- **Finally Set Prices** – Once all spaces exist, set individual prices in the Pricing tab

!!! tip
    The step-by-step navigation highlights which steps are required and prevents you from setting prices until both days and classes exist.
