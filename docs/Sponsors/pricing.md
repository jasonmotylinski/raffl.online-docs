# Setting Sponsor Prices

Once you've added days and classes to your sponsor event, you can set the price for each sponsorship space.

2. Click the **Pricing** tab in the left navigation

!!! note
    The Pricing tab is only available after you've added at least one day and one group with classes.

## Price Grid Layout

The pricing grid displays:

- **Rows** – Classes, grouped by their group
- **Columns** – Days
- **Cells** – Individual sponsorship spaces with price input fields

For example:
```
                Friday AM    Friday PM    Saturday AM    Saturday PM
Puppy Classes
  Best Puppy      $50         $50           $50            $50
  Reserve Puppy   $50         $50           $50            $50

Adult Classes
  Best in Show    $100        $100          $100           $100
  Reserve         $75         $75           $75            $75
```

## Setting Individual Prices

1. Click the **Pricing** tab
2. Enter the price for each sponsorship space in the input fields
3. Leave blank or enter **0** for free sponsorship spaces
4. Click **Save All Prices** to save your changes

!!! tip
    Prices can include cents (e.g., $10.50). PayPal fees will be added during checkout.

## Bulk Price Setting

To set all prices to the same amount:

1. Click the **Pricing** tab
2. Enter a price in the **"Set All Prices To..."** field
3. Click **Set All Prices To...**
4. Click **Save All Prices**

This is useful when you want a uniform price across all sponsorship spaces.

## Editing Prices Later

You can change prices at any time, even after sponsors have purchased spaces:
