# How to Connect Raffl.online to Your PayPal Account

Raffl.online integrates directly with your PayPal account. To enable this integration, you’ll need your __Paypal business email address__, __Client ID__ and __Client Secret__.

## Paypal Business Email Address
The Paypal business email address is the primary address associated with the Paypal account. It is also typically used to log into Paypal.

## Retrieving your PayPal credentials

1.  Go to the __[PayPal Developer Dashboard (Live)](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/live)__ and log in with your PayPal account.
1. Check if you already have an existing app listed.
    * If yes, click on the app name to view the Client ID and Client Secret.
    * You can send these credentials to me once located.
1. If you don’t see an existing app:
    * Click “Create App”.
    * When prompted, select “Merchant” as the app type.
    * Enter a name for your app (e.g., “Raffl Integration”) and click “Create App”.
    * Once the app is created, you’ll be shown your Client ID and Client Secret.

⚠️ Make sure you are creating the app under the Live tab (not Sandbox), as Raffl.online uses live PayPal credentials.
